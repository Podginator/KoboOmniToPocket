# Getting Started Guide. 

Here is a small guide to getting this up and running on your local environment. 

*Changes made are done so at your own risk. This requires updating the Kobo Devices firmware. This should be safe, but you do so at your own risk* 

## Prerequisits. 

**Important** The instructions provided here are for a Kobo Clara HD Device. ***For Other Devices, please follow the guide at #TBD***

Currently this implementation requires you to host the server yourself, as it uses /etc/hosts file to redirect to a static ip. In this guide the output only works on the same wifi network, however it is possible to also use a public ip to achieve the same thing, but accessible on every network. 

In the future I am looking into a version that is hosted, rather than having a local version.  

This guide will assume the use of raspberry pi or equivalent linux based machine to host the server. If on windows, you should be able to follow along using the [Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Please not that I have no tested this on the WSL. 


## Updating your Kobo Clara HD e-reader. 

*Note* that the attached file is using version 4.37.21533 for a Kobo Clara HD E-Reader. If you need to follow these instructions for other versions, please use the following [website](https://pgaskin.net/KoboStuff/kobofirmware.html). 

Please go to section #TBD to see how to create the KoboRoot file from scratch. 


### Updating
Attached in this respository is a file, KoboRoot.tg.gz. It is located in the resources folder of this repository.

This file contains a firmware update, based on Firmware 4.37.21533 (June 2023). In order to install this you must place it in the .kobo directory of your Kobo Device. Connect your device via USB, and place this file in the .kobo directory. This file may be hidden, and you will have to show hidden files if doing this via Explorer (Mac = CMD+.)

Reboot your device as you should see an update screen. Once completed, you will be placed back in the kobo screen. 

This update has done 2 things: 

* Enabled TelNet on your device (See [Here](https://yingtongli.me/blog/2018/07/30/kobo-telnet.html))
* Modified the libnickel library to point to a new host for the pocket app. 

## Modifying your host file to redirect to the Raspberry Pi or equivalent.

* On your server machie (IE: Raspberry Pi), run the following command `hostname -I` This will get the network ip of the device. Note this down, as you will need it for the next step. 

* Get the IP Address of your Kobo Device, You can see this in Settings -> Device Information. It should be in a format as follows: `192.168.x.x`    
    
* Telnet into the device by entering the following command `telnet {ip address}` - Replace {ip address} with the ip with the one got from your server machine.   
    * You should see a login screen. Enter `root`
    * It is a good idea to add a password here, do this by entering `passwd`.

* Enter the following command `sudo sh -c 'echo "{ip address} text.fckpocket.com fckpocket.com" >> /etc/hosts'` - once again replacing {ip address} with the one got from your server machine.

* Reboot the device. 

## Running the Proxy

On the server device (ie: Raspberry pi), in the terminal, do the following

* Install NodeJs on the raspberry pi device. You can do so by following [this guide](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/install-nodejs-and-npm-on-raspberry-pi/#Method_1_Install_NodeJS_and_NPM_From_the_NodeSource_Repo)

* Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/Podginator/KoboOmnivoreConverter` 

* Run the following commands
    * `cd KoboOmnivoreConverter`
    * `npm install`
    * `npm build`
    * `node ./index.js &`

* The proxy is now running in the background. Rebooting the device will stop the server. See [here](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/run-a-program-on-your-raspberry-pi-at-startup/)

## Connecting to Omnivore
In order to connect to Omnivore you need to do the following

* Create an API Key at the following url https://omnivore.app/settings/api
* Connect your Kobo e-reader device via USB. 
    * In folder `.kobo/Kobo/` There is a file called `Kobo eReader.conf`
    * Open this file and edit the following section. In the AccessToken section add the API Key created on Omnivore
    ```
    [Pocket]
    AccessToken=<API Key> 
    LastSync=0
    RemoveContentWhenRead=false
    UnsyncedUrls=@Invalid()
    Username=<Email>
    ```
* Reboot the device.

Now, when syncing articles, it should point instead to your local server. It will download articles from here. Pocket is no longer communicated with from here-on. 

### Troubleshooting

* Ensure that both the Raspberry Pi and the Kobo Ereader are on the same network.
